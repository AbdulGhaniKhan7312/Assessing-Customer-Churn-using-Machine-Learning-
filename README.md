# Assessing Customer Churn using Machine Learning

### Does Logistic Regression or Random Forest produce a higher accuracy score in predicting telecom churn in India?

1. Calculate and print the churn rate, and identify the categorical variables in churn_df.
2. Perform feature scaling separating the appropriate features and scaling them. Define your scaled features and target variables for the churn prediction model.
3. Split the processed data into training and testing sets giving names of X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test using an 80-20 split, setting a random state of 42 for reproducibility.
4. Train Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models, setting a random seed of 42.
5. Assess the models on test data.
